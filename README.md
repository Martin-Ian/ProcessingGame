# ProcessingGame
A game I have made in processing

To run, Either open this with Processing, or unzip the application folder to run 
a pre-compiled exe


* Keep in mind that these files need to be in a folder called 'Main' to run with Processing

** To play, use arrowkeys or WASD and complete levels by running into each enemy while dodging their attacks!
